**Project Introduction**

The goal of the January Code Jam through TripleTen was to create a website to help anyone who may be involved in an emergency situation. Our team created Emergency Connect, a website that connects the public to volunteer opportunities near them. In times of need, especially after natural disasters, we know so many people who want to help but aren't sure where to start. Emergency Connect allows people to donate their funds to emergency relief groups and learn more about four international charities actively taking volunteers to aid various causes. There is also information to be proactive and help others prepare in case of emergencies.

**Technologies and Techniques**

  - Functional forms and buttons
  - Templates for cards
